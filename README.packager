CMake on MeeGo
--------------

CMaker is splitted in 2 sub-projects (cmake and cmake-gui)
to avoid to be blocked by Qt build.

The following workflow should be used to update cmake:
 1. update cmake.spec
 2. update cmake.changes
 3. run pre_checking.sh script (sync cmake-gui.spec and cmake-gui.changes)
